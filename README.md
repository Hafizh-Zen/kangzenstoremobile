## ASSIGNMENT 2
1. Explain how you implemented the checklist above step-by-step (not just following the tutorial).

Project Setup: Initiated a new Django project by running django-admin startproject mysite.
App Creation: Created a new application within the project using python manage.py startapp myapp.
Database Configuration: Configured settings.py to connect to a PostgreSQL database for production and SQLite for development.
Model Development: Defined models in models.py to represent the data structures needed for the application.
Admin Interface: Registered models with the Django admin site to make them accessible through the Django admin interface.
View Logic: Implemented view functions in views.py that handle different routes' logic and data processing.
URL Mapping: Set up URL configurations in urls.py to route requests to the appropriate views.
Templates: Created HTML templates to render data sent from views.
Testing and Debugging: Wrote tests for views and models and used Django's debugging tools to ensure everything works as expected.
Deployment: Deployed the application on a cloud platform, setting up environment variables and ensuring security settings.

2. Explain the use of git in software development!

Git is a tool that helps us keep track of changes in the project. It's like a history book that lets us see past changes, try out new ideas without messing up the main project, and work with others easily. It's very important for making sure everything goes smoothly and safely when many people are working together.

3. In your opinion, out of all the frameworks available, why is Django used as the starting point for learning software development?

Django is great for beginners because it has everything you need to build a website all in one place. It’s also well-explained through lots of guides and has a big group of people who can help you learn and solve problems. This makes it easier to start building websites quickly.

4. Why is the Django model called an ORM?

ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. In Django, it means you can work with the database using Python code instead of having to write complicated database queries. This makes it safer and easier to get data in and out of the database.

## ASSIGNMENT 3

1. Explain why we need data delivery in implementing a platform.

When a user requests information, the platform processes the data, or synchronizes with other services, data delivery is essential to the platform's functionality since it makes sure that everything functions together. When data isn't transmitted correctly, the platform feels sluggish, unstable, or even malfunctioning. Transporting data from one location to another is not as simple as it seems; it also needs to be done quickly and accurately to provide users with a flawless experience.

2. In your opinion, which is better, XML or JSON? Why is JSON more popular than XML?

For the most part, I believe that JSON is superior to XML in most circumstances. JSON is simpler to write, easier on the eyes, and works flawlessly with JavaScript, which is widely used these days. Despite its strength, XML seems cumbersome and excessively intricate for numerous things that JSON accomplishes more efficiently and rapidly. The main factor behind JSON's popularity in web development is how simple it is to use, particularly when interacting with APIs. Most developers like it since it completes the task more quickly and efficiently.

3. Explain the functional usage of is_valid() method in Django forms. Also explain why we need the method in forms?

In Django forms, the is_valid() method acts as a kind of data checkpoint, ensuring that everything is in order before continuing. Its purpose is to guarantee that only clean, useable data is handled and that user-submitted data passes the required validation checks. Without it, you run the danger of mistakes or even security problems brought on by corrupt or malicious data. It's important to preserve the integrity of your app and make sure that interactions run well for all parties involved, not only to abide by the regulations.

4. Why do we need csrf_token when creating a form in Django? What could happen if we did not use csrf_token on a Django form? How could this be leveraged by an attacker?

It is essential to utilize csrf_token in Django forms as it provides an extra security layer that guards against malicious attacks, particularly CSRF assaults. Without it, attackers may readily fool users into carrying out undesired tasks, such as modifying account settings or completing transactions, without their knowledge. Although it's a straightforward token, without it, hackers might take advantage of user confidence and tamper with important data on your app. Therefore, it's a minor but essential component of protection that you shouldn't ignore.


5. Explain how you implemented the checklist above step-by-step (not just following the tutorial).

I start by making a new file called form.py that contains the fields and the model. I then produced the four views that the assignment asked for. I then make the base.html, create_product_entry.html, and update the main.html. After doing all of this, I routed every view in the urls.py file. Finally, I changed the settings.py templates so that I could add products using the online form.

## ASSIGNMENT 4

1. What is the difference between HttpResponseRedirect() and redirect()?

In Django, both HttpResponseRedirect() and redirect() are used for redirects, but they differ in how easy they are to use. HttpResponseRedirect() is a more basic function that requires you to provide the full URL or path where you want to send the user. It's useful when you need more control, but you have to manually handle the URL.

On the other hand, redirect() is more flexible and easier to use. It can take a full URL, a path, a view name, or even a model instance. This makes it simpler, especially when you’re redirecting to a view or object without needing to build the URL yourself. While both do the same job, redirect() is more convenient for most situations.

2. Explain how the MoodEntry model is linked with User!

The MoodEntry model can be associated with the User model through a ForeignKey field, creating a one-to-many relationship where each mood entry is tied to a specific user. For example, using ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE) connects each mood entry to a user, and if that user is deleted, their related mood entries are automatically removed as well.

3. What is the difference between authentication and authorization, and what happens when a user logs in? Explain how Django implements these two concepts.

Authentication verifies a user's identity by checking credentials like a username and password, answering "Who are you?" Authorization comes after and determines what actions or resources a user can access, answering "What can you do?"

When a user logs in, Django's auth framework handles authentication by checking the credentials and creating a session for the user. After authentication, Django uses a permissions system for authorization, determining what the user is allowed to do based on their permissions or group memberships. In short, authentication identifies the user, and authorization controls their access.

4. How does Django remember logged-in users? Explain other uses of cookies and whether all cookies are safe to use.

Django remembers logged-in users by using cookies. When a user logs in successfully, Django creates a session and sends a cookie to the user's browser. This cookie contains a session ID, which Django uses to link the user to their session data stored on the server. With each subsequent request, the browser sends the cookie back to the server, allowing Django to retrieve the session data and identify the user as logged in.

Cookies have various other uses beyond managing sessions. They can store user preferences, track site visits, or enable personalized experiences, such as remembering items in a shopping cart or maintaining language settings across visits.

However, not all cookies are equally safe. Cookies can be vulnerable to security risks, like cross-site scripting (XSS) or cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. To enhance security, Django provides features like HttpOnly cookies (which prevent JavaScript access) and Secure cookies (which are only sent over HTTPS connections). Proper cookie management and implementing these protections help mitigate potential risks.

In summary, Django uses cookies to manage logged-in users by storing a session ID. While cookies serve many purposes, it's essential to implement security measures to ensure they are safe.

5. Explain how did you implement the checklist step-by-step (apart from following the tutorial).

I began by developing functions for user registration, login, and logout in the views.py file and then connected these functions to the appropriate paths in urls.py. After that, I created the templates register.html and login.html to provide the user interface for registration and login. For the logout feature, I added a button in main.html to allow users to log out easily.

Once the functions were complete, I created two user accounts, each with three associated data entries, and ensured this data could be accessed locally. I used user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE) in the model to link the data to the respective user.

Additionally, I implemented cookies to track user activity, specifically the last login time. I modified the show_main, login_user, and logout_user views to manage this functionality. The last login time is stored in a cookie and displayed in main.html. I set the cookie when the user logs in and handled its expiration when the user logs out.


## ASSIGNMENT 5

1. If there are multiple CSS selectors for an HTML element, explain the priority order of these CSS selectors! 

CSS allows developers to style HTML elements, but when multiple selectors apply to a single element, understanding their priority is crucial.

Inline styles (style="color: red;") have the highest priority, overriding both external and internal styles. Next are IDs (#header), which are unique to a single element and take precedence over classes.

Classes (.button { color: white; }) can be applied to multiple elements and have lower specificity than IDs but higher than element selectors (e.g., div, p) and the universal selector (*), which have the lowest priority.

If two selectors have the same specificity, the one defined later in the stylesheet takes precedence, demonstrating the cascading nature of CSS. This system helps developers control the appearance of web pages effectively.

2. Why does responsive design become an important concept in web application development? Give examples of applications that have and have not implemented responsive design!

Responsive design is essential in modern web development due to the wide range of devices and screen sizes used to access the internet. As smartphones, tablets, and varying screen resolutions become more common, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices is crucial.

The main benefit of responsive design is improved user experience. It ensures that elements are appropriately sized, menus are accessible, and content is readable on any device, whether a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone. Websites like Amazon and Netflix showcase responsive design by automatically adjusting layouts, images, and navigation for optimal viewing. In contrast, sites lacking responsiveness often frustrate users with small text, difficult navigation, or excessive scrolling.

In short, responsive design is key to creating accessible, user-friendly applications in today’s multi-device world, ultimately boosting user satisfaction and engagement.

3. Explain the differences between margin, border, and padding, and how to implement these three things!

Understanding margin, border, and padding is essential in CSS, as they each serve a unique role in the box model for web design.

Margin is the space outside an element's border, creating separation between the element and its surroundings. It’s transparent and can be set using properties like margin-top, margin-bottom, or the shorthand margin. For example, margin: 10px 20px; sets a 10-pixel margin on the top and bottom, and a 20-pixel margin on the left and right sides.

Border is the line that surrounds an element's padding and content. It can be styled in terms of thickness, color, and pattern (e.g., dotted, double). The border occupies space and affects the element's overall size. It can be set with properties like border-width, border-style, border-color, or the shorthand border, e.g., border: 3px dotted blue;.

Padding is the space inside the element, between its content and border. It prevents content from touching the border and can be adjusted with properties like padding-top, padding-bottom, or the shorthand padding. For example, padding: 5px 15px; applies 5-pixel padding to the top and bottom and 15-pixel padding to the left and right sides.

In short, margin creates space outside an element, padding creates space inside, and the border separates padding from the outer margin.

4. Explain the concepts of flex box and grid layout along with their uses!

Flexbox and Grid Layout are two powerful CSS systems for designing flexible and responsive web layouts.

Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is suited for one-dimensional layouts, allowing items in a container to align along a single axis—either horizontally or vertically. It dynamically distributes space among items with properties like justify-content, align-items, and flex-direction. For example, creating an evenly spaced, centered navigation bar is straightforward using Flexbox.

Grid Layout is a two-dimensional system, perfect for complex layouts involving both rows and columns. It provides precise control over layout structure using properties like grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, and grid-area. For instance, arranging a gallery of images with captions can be efficiently handled using Grid.

In summary, Flexbox is ideal for simpler, one-dimensional layouts, while Grid is best for more intricate, two-dimensional designs. Both are essential for building responsive, visually appealing web pages.

5. Explain how you implemented the checklist above step-by-step (not just following the tutorial)!

First, to have the delete and edit functions on the website, I created 2 functions in the views.py, which are delete_mood and edit_mood. Then both of these functions are used in the templates. Then I added these functions to the urls.py. After that, I added Tailwind to the folder so i could use CSS. Then, i modified my website to have a spotify look to it as i like the minimalistic design. When there are no product, it will display a message and a picture of Vegeta. In each card moof, there are two buttons which are edit and delete. Other than that, I also added a navbar with features on it.

## ASSIGNMENT 6

1. Explain the benefits of using JavaScript in developing web applications!

JavaScript provides several benefits in web development, including enabling interactivity, client-side processing, and asynchronous operations. This allows developers to create dynamic, fast-loading pages that don't require constant communication with the server. JavaScript is also cross-platform, running in all modern browsers, and is supported by a vast ecosystem of frameworks and libraries like React and Angular, which makes developing complex applications easier and more efficient.

2. Explain why we need to use await when we call fetch()! What would happen if we don't use await?

The fetch() function in JavaScript is asynchronous, returning a promise that resolves when data is fetched. Using await ensures that the program pauses and waits for the promise to resolve before continuing execution. Without await, the code would move to the next line before the data is ready, potentially leading to errors such as trying to access undefined or incomplete data.

3. Why do we need to use the csrf_exempt decorator on the view used for AJAX POST?

The csrf_exempt decorator in Django is used for views that handle AJAX POST requests to bypass the CSRF token validation, which is a security feature that prevents cross-site request forgery attacks. Since adding a CSRF token in AJAX requests might require additional handling, this decorator allows easier processing of the requests. However, it should be used carefully, as bypassing CSRF protection can introduce security vulnerabilities if not managed properly.

4. On this week's tutorial, the user input sanitization is done in the back-end as well. Why can't the sanitization be done just in the front-end?

Input sanitization should not rely solely on the front-end because users can manipulate or bypass client-side validation. Front-end sanitization improves user experience by catching errors early, but it does not guarantee security. Backend sanitization is essential because it ensures that only safe and valid data is processed and stored, protecting against malicious attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting, and ensuring data integrity.

5.  Explain how you implemented the checklist above step-by-step (not just following the tutorial)!

## ASSINGMENT 7

1. Explain what are stateless widgets and stateful widgets, and explain the difference between them.

Stateless widgets are immutable widgets, meaning they cannot be altered or modified once created. These widgets are rendered a single time since their properties remain constant throughout the runtime of the application. Examples include text labels or static UI components.

In contrast, stateful widgets are dynamic and can change during runtime based on user interactions or other triggers. These widgets rely on a state object that manages changes and rebuilds the widget as needed. Examples of stateful widgets include interactive buttons or text fields that update dynamically. Unlike stateless widgets, stateful widgets are rebuilt multiple times as their state changes.

2. Mention the widgets that you have used for this project and its uses.

For this project, various widgets were used to build the app’s functionality and interface. The MaterialApp widget served as the root, providing the app's theme and navigation structure. The Scaffold widget helped create the overall layout, including sections like the app bar and body.

The AppBar widget was utilized for the title bar, while Material and InkWell widgets provided a card-like design with clickable functionality. Other widgets like Text, Icon, and SnackBar were employed to display text, show icons, and give user feedback, respectively.



3. What is the use-case for setState()? Explain the variable that can be affected by setState()

The setState() method is essential for updating the state of widgets that are built using StatefulWidget. When called, it triggers a rebuild of the widget, allowing the UI or other components to update based on changes in state. This method is commonly used for interactive widgets that need to adapt dynamically during runtime, such as form inputs or buttons that reflect user actions.

4. Explain the difference between const and final keyword.

Both const and final are used to define variables that do not change once assigned. However, const is for compile-time constants, meaning the value must be determined before the application starts. On the other hand, final is used for variables assigned only once, but their value can be determined at runtime. While they share similarities, const is ideal for fixed values, and final is more suitable for runtime-initialized variables.

# ASSIGNMENT 8

1. What is the purpose of const in Flutter? Explain the advantages of using const in Flutter code. When should we use const, and when should it not be used?
The const keyword in Flutter is used to create compile-time constants that do not need to be rebuilt unnecessarily. It designates elements as static, which enhances performance by reducing resource consumption since the element is already prepared and does not require additional computation. const is ideal for widgets that remain unchanged and are built only once. However, it should not be used for dynamic widgets that depend on user interactions or data changes.

2. Explain and compare the usage of Column and Row in Flutter. Provide example implementations of each layout widget!
Both Column and Row are used to arrange child elements in Flutter, but they differ in the direction they align the elements. A Row arranges elements horizontally, side by side, while a Column arranges them vertically, one below the other. The choice between the two depends on how the UI elements need to be displayed.

3. List the input elements you used on the form page in this assignment. Are there other Flutter input elements you didn’t use in this assignment? Explain!
The form page in this task used TextFormField for inputs like name, price, description, stock, and category. However, Flutter provides other input elements, such as Slider, Radio, Switch, and DropdownButton. These elements are suitable for specific input needs, like selecting a value range with a Slider or picking a category from a dropdown using DropdownButton. Although these input types offer more options, their use depends on the app’s requirements, and in this case, they were not implemented.

4. How do you set the theme within a Flutter application to ensure consistency? Did you implement a theme in your application?
To define a theme, the MaterialApp widget is configured with a ThemeData object, where key colors, secondary colors, and other theme properties are specified. This ensures a consistent color scheme throughout the application whenever the theme is invoked. In this app, a theme was implemented using dark colors to match the website’s design, which was better suited than the default white background, creating a cohesive look and feel.

5. How do you manage navigation in a multi-page Flutter application?
Navigation in this app is managed using two methods: a drawer navigation menu and on-screen buttons. Internally, Flutter’s navigation system functions like a stack or FIFO structure. When navigating to a new page, the Navigator.push method is used to add the route to the stack. Routes are often linked to the names of their respective widgets. The navigator tracks the user’s movement between pages, maintaining a history that makes it easy to return to the previous page by simply removing the top of the stack. This approach ensures seamless navigation while keeping track of user activity.
